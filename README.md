# GeoQuiz

--------------------

It's a geographical game that will test your knowledge on the political map of the world. You will try to guess as many countries as possible, based only on borders and geographical objects surrounding it.
The new brand rating system will help you on your way:

- Countries are listed in order of increasing difficulty (more "popular at start").
- Each win or defeat will change your start point (rating), making your game easier or competitive.
- The game will remember countries that you handle too effortlessly or, on the contrarily, hard and will move its position.
